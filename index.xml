As the urban population of the earth continues to grow, the current city model needs to evolve. Climate change has underlined the necessity to rethink the way we interact with our city. From the way we commute to how we use the power grid, there are definitively things we can do to improve our carbon footprint. But the environment isn’t the only problem plaguing our cities.</description></item><item><title>Building an MQTTv5 server in python from scratch</title><link>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/blog/mqtt-client/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/blog/mqtt-client/</guid><description>Building an MQTTv5 server in python from scratch Introduction
The Internet Of Things (IOT) is the collection of physical devices which have sensors, processing ability and a way to connect to other devices, often over the Internet. For example, a weather station which collected humidity, temperature and wind speed/direction and then reported this data to a server could be considered an IOT device. Communication between these devices and a server, also called peers or nodes, is an interesting problem as we need to balance speed, computational cost and reliability.</description></item><item><title>InfiniHacks</title><link>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/portfolio/infinihacks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 17:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/portfolio/infinihacks/</guid><description>As part of the InfiniHacks hackathon team, I designed the logo and helped the development of the website. I evaluated different SaaS platforms and used Wix to create the website based on Figma wireframes.
I was also contacting potential sponsors and mentors for our event. This allowed us to offer a better experience for our attendees, by giving them both great prizes and the opportunity to get help from mentors.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating IOT data</title><link>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/blog/aggregating-iot-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/blog/aggregating-iot-data/</guid><description>Aggregating IOT data Introduction
Data runs the world. Each day, 2.5 million terabytes of data are created by humans (source). The Internet Of Things (IOT) accounts for a huge portion of this statistic. The IOT is the collection of devices with embedded sensors and that collect and exchange data over the internet or similar protocols. IOT accounts for a large portion of the statistic mentioned above.

I’m sure we’ve all been told to make sure that our browser shows a little lock icon when visiting a website. You probably know that the “lock” means that your connection to the web server is secure, no one can read your passwords or credit card information except for you and the server. You also probably know that the “lock” represents HTTPS (with the S standing for “secure”), whereas the lack of a lock represents HTTP.</description></item><item><title>A Look Back on HTN 2021</title><link>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/blog/a-retrospective-on-hackthenorth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/blog/a-retrospective-on-hackthenorth/</guid><description>A Look Back on HTN 2021 TL;DR
We built an app that tracked people using security cameras in stores and won the Best Entrepreneurship Hack and Best Use of Google Cloud prizes. More information is available on our devpost.
Introduction HackTheNorth is the biggest hackathon in Canada, with over 3500 participants and 447 projects submitted in 2021 on their devpost. Being the biggest Canadian hackathon, HTN provides participants with a plethora of mentors and workshops.</description></item><item><title>HiveHQ</title><link>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/portfolio/hivehq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 12:07:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomas.mcnamer.ca/portfolio/hivehq/</guid><description>We built a system that uses existing security cameras to track shoppers through the store. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we can count the number of users in the store, helping in the enforcement of social distancing. However, the functionality doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. We can track individual shoppers&amp;rsquo; journeys across many cameras, allowing us to understand the user&amp;rsquo;s shopping habits. Using this, we can help store managers make more informed decisions about their stores and gauge the efficacy of in-store advertising campaigns and other marketing strategies.</description></item></channel></rss>
