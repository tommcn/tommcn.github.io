shortDescription: I worked on Hive-HQ with some friends as part of the 2021 edition of
    [HacktheNorth](https://hackthenorth.com/). We used computer vision to help stores
    understand user shopping patterns. We won the "Best use of Google Cloud" and
    "Best Entrepreneurship Hack, presented by Contrary" prizes.

We built a system that uses existing security cameras to track shoppers through the
store. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we can count the number of users in the
store, helping in the enforcement of social distancing. However, the functionality
doesn't stop there. We can track individual shoppers' journeys across many
cameras, allowing us to understand the user's shopping habits. Using this, we can
help store managers make more informed decisions about their stores and gauge the
efficacy of in-store advertising campaigns and other marketing strategies.

As part of the team, I wrote the code which communicates with the dedicated AI
server and serves information with the user-facing website. I also wrote the
frontend logic for the website. Finally, I adapted the code to work on Google
Cloud Platform's servers.
