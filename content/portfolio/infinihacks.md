As part of the InfiniHacks hackathon team, I designed the logo and helped the development
of the website. I evaluated different SaaS platforms and used Wix to create the website
based on Figma wireframes.

I was also contacting potential sponsors and mentors for our event. This allowed us to offer
a better experience for our attendees, by giving them both great prizes and the opportunity
to get help from mentors.
